# My Progress

## Week 1
The first week of my training was truly engaging and insightful. I was introduced to several core concepts and got a clearer understanding of how software development and deployment workflows are structured in top MNCs. The first week of my training was really intresting. I learned a lot of new things like how the software is brought up in the top mncs etc. And Kanika mam really taught well on different types of testing. 

One of the major highlights of this week was the session on software testing, where Kanika Ma‚Äôam explained the various types of testing in a very effective and easy-to-understand manner. Her sessions helped me build a solid foundation in understanding the importance of quality assurance in the software lifecycle.

Additionally, I took the initiative to complete a course on Agile Development offered by Simplilearn, which complemented my training perfectly. This course provided me with foundational knowledge of the Agile methodology, helping me better understand how modern teams manage iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaborative work environments.

I have attached my Agile certification below for reference.

## Week 2
Since I have been actively involved in multiple club activities during college, I‚Äôve already had hands-on exposure to Git and version control. As a result, the second week felt more like a refresher for me, helping me brush up on the fundamentals I was already familiar with.

Rajat Sir conducted the sessions with patience, ensuring that even the most basic doubts were addressed clearly before moving forward. His calm approach made the learning environment very comfortable, especially for those new to the topic.

Overall, it was a decent session that helped reinforce the concepts of Git and version control workflows.

I have attached my course completion certificate for the Git module below.

### Week 3

I personally use Linux most of the time, so this week‚Äôs hands-on session with Linux commands felt quite comfortable for me. On the second day, I practiced all the essential commands on my personal system to reinforce my understanding.

I've uploaded the command outputs as a text file for reference and future revision.
